I found it as a nice mathematical problem.
Short statement Problem statement itself is already quite short, so no summary is needed.
You are given two positive integers \(n, m\).
Calculate the number of ordered pairs \(a, b\) satisfying the following conditions:
\(1 \leq a \leq n, 1 \leq b \leq m\) \(b \times gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\) Solution Let \(x = a + b\)</description></item><item><title>Editorial: [CF] 258E</title><link>https://kaplanbar.github.io/posts/post-1/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kaplanbar.github.io/posts/post-1/</guid><description>I will share a solution to the problem CF 258E.
Short statement You are given \(n\) boxes where \(i\)-th box contains \(f_i\) flowers. All flowers in a box are same color (indistinguishable) and there are no two flowers in the different boxes that have the same color.
We want to select exactly \(s\) flowers from those boxes. Find out how many different ways to select in modulo \(10^9 + 7\).</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://kaplanbar.github.io/about/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kaplanbar.github.io/about/</guid><description>I am Yilmaz Baris Kaplan.
