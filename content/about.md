I am Yılmaz Barış Kaplan, currently studying my last semester at Istanbul Technical University, Turkey.

You can find more details on my background at [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaplanbar/) page.

I am interested in reading different sources on philosophy, economics and politics. In this blog, I might share my thoughts and reviews on these topics.

I also like working on puzzles and algorithm problems on my free time, I plan to share them occasionally.
