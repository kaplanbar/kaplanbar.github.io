Hello, I am a senior undergraduate student at Istanbul Technical University, studying Computer Engineering. You can find my resume on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaplanbar/) page.

In my free time, I like to solve algorithm problems and participate in competitions. I am also interested in philosophy, economics and politics.

In this blog, I plan to share algorithm problems that I like, posts related to computer engineering and ideas on other areas that I am interested in.
